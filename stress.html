        <p>Stress is a natural reaction to challenging situations, triggering the body's fight-or-flight response. While short-term stress can motivate and improve performance, chronic stress negatively impacts both mental and physical health.</p>

        <h5>What Part of the Brain Does It Affect?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Amygdala:</b> Becomes overactive, intensifying emotions like fear and anxiety.</li>
            <li><b>Hippocampus:</b> Shrinks under prolonged stress, impairing memory and learning.</li>
            <li><b>Prefrontal Cortex:</b> Reduced activity weakens focus and decision-making.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>What Hormones Are Involved?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cortisol:</b> Known as the stress hormone, it is released during stressful situations. Chronic cortisol elevation can harm the brain and body.</li>
            <li><b>Adrenaline:</b> Triggers the "fight-or-flight" response, increasing heart rate and energy.</li>
            <li><b>Norepinephrine:</b> Works alongside adrenaline to heighten focus but can contribute to anxiety under chronic stress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Effects of Stress</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Short-Term Effects:</b> Rapid heart rate, heightened alertness, and emotional tension.</li>
            <li><b>Long-Term Effects:</b> Sleep disturbances, weakened immunity, and risk of anxiety or depression.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Signs of Stress</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Frequent headaches or muscle tension.</li>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating or irritability.</li>
            <li>Fatigue and sleep disturbances.</li>
            <li>Digestive issues or weakened immunity.</li>
        </ul>
