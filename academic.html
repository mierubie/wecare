        <p>Academic pressure refers to the stress students feel when striving to meet high academic expectations. It arises from personal goals, family expectations, peer competition, or institutional standards. While some pressure can motivate students, excessive academic stress can negatively affect mental and physical well-being.</p>

        <h5>What Part of the Brain Does It Affect?</h5>
        <p>Academic pressure activates the brain's stress response, particularly affecting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Amygdala:</b> Processes emotions like fear and stress, becoming overactive under academic pressure. </li>
            <li><b>Hippocampus:</b> Supports learning and memory but is sensitive to high cortisol levels, leading to memory issues. </li>
            <li><b>Prefrontal Cortex:</b> Helps with focus and decision-making but weakens under chronic stress. </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>What Hormones Are Involved?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cortisol:</b> High cortisol levels from prolonged stress impair memory and concentration.</li>
            <li><b>Adrenaline:</b> Increases heart rate and energy during stress but can impair cognition when chronically elevated.</li>
            <li><b>Serotonin and Dopamine:</b> Chronic stress reduces these neurotransmitters, leading to sadness or lack of motivation.</li>
        </ul>
